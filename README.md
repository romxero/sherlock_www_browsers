Web browsers for Sherlock use

These are web browser wrapped in singularity containers for use on Sherlock. 
The reason for these is that web browsers are usually a pain to get working in a clustered environment. 
These are set up so you can run and go with the browsers. The containers are lightweight as well.

### Debian stretch-slim docker image.

* Firefox - Standard versions 66.

* Firefox Developers Edition - Bleeding edge, for web developers and power users.

* Chromium - Google Chrome for linux

* Midori - Lightweight and fast

* The default browser is firefox developers edition.
